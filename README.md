# AI-Powered Cybersecurity for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Devices

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rapid integration of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices into Moroccan healthcare systems, hospitals are achieving unprecedented operational efficiency. However, this progress also exposes critical vulnerabilities in cybersecurity, especially in safeguarding sensitive patient data and maintaining system availability. Recent cyberattacks targeting Moroccan institutions highlight the urgent need for robust, locally developed solutions tailored to the nation's specific challenges.

In response to this critical issue, and within the framework of the MDFDS Hackathon on "AI for Healthcare," we propose an AI-driven cybersecurity solution designed specifically for IoMT networks. Our system uses Artificial Intelligence to continuously analyze network logs generated by IoMT devices, enabling the early detection and prediction of potential cyber threats before they disrupt healthcare services.

Our approach combines intelligent feature extraction from raw network data with state-of-the-art machine learning models—including boosting, bagging, and probabilistic classifiers—while ensuring lightweight architecture for fast inference and easy integration into hospital systems. After rigorous preprocessing and training phases, our best model (GradientBoostingClassifier) achieved outstanding results on unseen data:
- **Accuracy**: 99.46%
- **Precision**: 99.99%
- **Recall**: 99.33%
- **F1 Score**: 99.66%
- **AUC**: 99.97%
- **Sampling**:	Under
- **PCA**: Without PCA

This solution empowers Moroccan healthcare institutions to proactively secure their IoMT ecosystems, protect patient confidentiality, comply with national cybersecurity regulations, and ensure safer, smarter healthcare services for the future.
